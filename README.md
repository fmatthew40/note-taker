 ## Description
 To start, I installed npm express.  Express.js allowed me to create and run a local server.  This allowed me to run and test my application until it could be deployed to Heroku.  After I set up a local server with express, I set up GET calls to bring up my json file.  Next, I set up a POST call so that the user would have the ability to add a note to the json file.  Insomnia allowed me to test my GET and POST calls until I could connect the front end. After that, I set up a function to write the data to the json data.  I then added in identification numbers to each note by using the Date.now method.  I connected the front end html pages so the site would function.  After I got all this added, I included functionality to delete the notes.  I deployed the application using Heroku.
